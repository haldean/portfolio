      <p>The <strong>
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/search/overview">
          App Engine Search API</a></strong> is an expressive API that allows
      users to perform advanced search queries on large, eventually-consistent
      indexes of data. Supported features include multilingual text analysis,
      automatic tokenization, a fully-featured boolean query language, numeric
      and date comparisons and geohashing.</p>

      <p>I worked on a three-engineer team at Google to build the Search API
      from July 2012 to present.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="http://haldean.org/button/">Button</a></strong> is an
      interface for controlling the color and brightness of lights in your home. It
      turns your Android device into a motion controller, where one dimension is
      hue and the other is saturation.</p>

      <p>Button acts as a frontend to the dimsum light controller, an
      application for a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino that allows users to control
      RGB LEDs from a web interface or from Button.</p>

      <p>Button was built as a personal project in September 2012.</p>

      <p><strong><a
          href="http://github.com/haldean/annotate23d/">annotate23d</a></strong>
      is an iPad implementation of <a
        href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~ygingold/annotations/"> Yotam Gingold, Takeo
        Igarashi and Denis Zorin's <em>Structured Annotations for 2D-to-3D
          Modelling</em></a>. The app allows users to sketch out a figure and
      annotate it to create a full 3D model from the sketch. Users can then
      export the model as a Wavefront OBJ file.  </p>

      <p>annotate23d was built as an undergraduate research project, advised by
      Yotam Gingold with the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/">Columbia
        Computer Graphics Group</a> in Spring 2012.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="http://github.com/haldean/subd/">subd</a></strong> is
      a software package for evaluating Loop and Catmull-Clarke subdivision
      surfaces. It supports arbitrary levels of subdivision (limited only by
      available system memory) normal interpolation and cel shading.</p>

      <p>subd was created as a final project for Michael Reed's Computer-Aided
      Geometric Design course in Spring 2012</p>

      <p><strong><a
          href="http://github.com/haldean/feynstein/">Feynstein</a></strong> is
      a programming language designed for making physical simulation accessible
      to those who want to experiment with physics but who do not have
      significant experience in computer science. It makes the process of going
      from an experiment’s conception to its simulation simple and fast, and
      provides the end user with accurate video renderings, either in a file or
      on screen.</p>

      <p>I was a member of the 5-person team that built Feynstein for Alfred Aho’s
      Programming Languages course at Columbia in Spring 2011. I was responsible
      for the compiler and geometry generation for the standard library of the
      language.</p>

      <p> <strong><a
          href="http://github.com/haldean/droidcopter/">Robocopter</a></strong>
      is a novel system architecture for quadricopter control in which the
      quadricopter can behave near-autonomously and processing is handled by an
      Android device on the quadricopter. The Android device communicates with a
      laptop, receiving commands from the host and sending imagery and sensor
      data back. The quadricopter was 3D printed and assembled by us.

      <p>I created Robocopter with Benjamin Bardin under the advisement of
      Professor Paul Blaer as a three-semester faculty-assisted undergraduate
      research project, Spring 2010 &mdash; Spring 2011.</p>
